JS single threaded

firstly created GEC and refer it THIS

different EC of global ( THIS value windo object) 
and node , dino ,bun

Server side render - have not window access 

=== Functional execution context ===
=== Eval execution context ===

=> let val1 = 10
   let val2 = 20

    function addNum(num1, num2) {
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
    }
    let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
    let result2 = addNum(10,2)

1. Run Global execution and allocate to THIS 

2. Memory creation phase 
 {
    adding variables 
    
    val1 => undefined
    val2 => undefined
    addNum => defination
    result1 => undefined
    result2 => undefined

 } - 1st cycle

3. Execution phase 
 {
    val1 => 10
    val2 => 5
    addNum => [new variable environment + execution thread] after work DELETE
    
}  - 2nd cycle
